git init
* init is short for initialize. Git realizes that we are asking it to create a repository at this location, and it responds by
creating a hidden folder called .git and stuff it with some configuration files and subfolder where it will store our snapshots
when we ask it to. 
.git represents the Git repository. its job is to store everything related to your project, including all commits, the project history, 
configuration files, and what have you. 
* There are two ways to obtain a Git repository:
    1. Create one using git init 
    2. Clone one using git clone {url}

git config --global user.name = {username} example git config --global user.name=Justina Williams
git config --global user.email = {email} example git config --global user.email=wjustina12@gmail.com

git add {filename} example | git add helloworld.py
    * In order to begin tracking a new file, you must use the command git add

git rm {filename} example | git remove helloworld.py

git commit -m "message" | example git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    * The git commit command has a flag, -m followed by the commmit message. The -m stands for message and is a mechanism for you to provide a meaningful
    reminder as to why you made this change.
