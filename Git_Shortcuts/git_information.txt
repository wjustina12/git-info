Where does thes Git respository live?
    Typically we ten to keep all the files for a project in one folder. If we are going to use Git as our version control
    system for that project, we first create a repository within that folder so that Git has a place to store our snapshots. 

What does Git commit do?
    Committing to Git is a two way process. You first add the files and then commit. Only the files that you add are committed. When we commit, 
    Git uses a specialized algorithm to safely tuck away everything that we added to its memory.

Git repository is divided into two parts?
    When we run the git add {filename}, Git makes a copy of the file and puts it in the index. We can think of the index as the staging area,
    wherein we cna put things until were sure we wato to commit to them. 
    When the git commit command is ran, it takes the contents of the staging area and stores those in the object database also known as Git's memory bank
